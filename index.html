<p> Prosecutors in Campbell County, Tennessee said on Monday that Trooper Isaiah Lloyd (inset) was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in two traffic stops of Patricia Wilson on August 16. Mother-of-two Wilson has claimed in a $100,000 lawsuit against the Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper that he'd used his police powers to sexually harass her and touched her inappropriately. The first traffic stop occurred on Interstate 75 in Northeast Tennessee, not far from the Kentucky border. Wilson was on her way to her evening janitorial job when Lloyd pulled her over for not wearing a seatbelt.</p>
